Here's my poster that looks into the relationship between specific genes in Maturity of Onset Diabetes of the Young (Foxa2, Foxa3, and HNF1B) and early mouse gastrulation. [here](Copy of SU22 PosterPresentations.com-36x48-Template-Forrest)

Check out this [awesome R Notebook](6_23_22_mouse_gastrulation_part3.nb.html) showing the code I used to gather my poster's data.

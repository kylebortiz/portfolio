Hello! I'm a current High School senior at Floyd B Buchanan Highschool who's aspiring to study either neurology or computer science. So far, I've done research at Clovis Community College using a single-cell RNA sequencing R database, and I'm currently an intern at Harvard Medical School. I wish to further my knowledge on neuroscience and computer science by assisting in any research projects that are available to me.
